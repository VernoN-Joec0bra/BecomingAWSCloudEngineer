#### Step 6: Storage Configuration

The default storage configuration was maintained:
- **Root Volume Size:** 8 GiB
- **Volume Type:** Default EBS configuration

#### Step 7: Advanced Details and User Data

Termination protection was **enabled** in the Advanced details pane to prevent accidental instance termination.

The following User Data script was deployed to configure the web server automatically upon instance launch:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum -y install httpd
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
echo '<html><h1>Hello From Your Web Server!</h1></html>' > /var/www/html/index.html
```

**Purpose of the script:**
- Installed Apache HTTP Server (httpd)
- Enabled httpd to start automatically on system boot
- Started the httpd service immediately
- Created a simple HTML test page

## Task 3: Security Group Configuration and Web Server Access

### Initial Access Attempt

An attempt was made to access the web server using the instance's public IPv4 address in a web browser. This attempt failed, as the security group had not yet been configured to allow inbound HTTP traffic.

**Key Learning:** Security groups functioned as virtual firewalls, controlling all ingress and egress traffic to instances.

### Security Group Modification

The security group was updated to permit HTTP traffic:

1. Navigated to Security Groups in the EC2 console
2. Selected the "Web Server security group"
3. Added a new inbound rule with the following configuration:
   - **Type:** HTTP
   - **Protocol:** TCP
   - **Port Range:** 80
   - **Source:** Anywhere-IPv4 (0.0.0.0/0)

**[Screenshot: Inbound Rules Configuration - HTTP Rule Addition]**
